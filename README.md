# KamFreBOT Discord Bot

## A simple Discord bot made by me for some of my private Discord servers

This Frankenstein abomination of a bot is something i have made few years ago. The resulting accumulation of me copying some codes from another GitHub repo (only some, not the entire repo)
Feel free to explore it by yourself

Go to `quotes.py` to customize the error message quotes.
  
* There also a meme command.
You can put your own memes on `/memes/` folder and use the meme command to send it randomly.

* You can also put custom sound into the `/audio/` folder
Use `localplay` command to play the audio
NOTE: The filename **IS** case sensitive. (For example, `[p]localplay lingsir_wengi.mp3`)

* You can customize the Error Logging channel
Open up `config.py` and put your desired channel ID on `home` variable

Put the token on `coin.json` file
